    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Unagi Sushi is a type of Maki sushi (rolled sushi) made by rolling ingredients in nori seaweed sheet and seasoned
        rice.</p>
    <p>The key ingredient is unagi or freshwater eel, which is known for the bold, rich, naturally sweet flavor, and
        soft texture. It`s a popular ingredient in many Japanese dishes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Unagi: Traditional unagi sushi contains grilled BBQ unagi (eel), a cooked fish flavored with teriyaki sauce
            or unagi sauce. It`s available in the frozen section at local Japanese grocery stores, or you can order
            canned unagi online from Amazon.</li>
        <li>Cucumber or Avocado: You can add cucumber strips or avocado slices to your roll. I also added some green
            onions for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Sushi Rice: Use Japanese short-grain rice for the best result.</li>
        <li>Sushi Vinegar: For seasoning the rice and adding more flavor to the dish. If you don`t have sushi vinegar,
            you can mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt as a replacement.</li>
        <li>Nori Seaweed Sheet: Look for seaweed sheets with a black color with a slightly green hue.</li>
        <li>Unagi Sauce: It`s optional, but it`ll take your unagi roll to the next level. Buy it at a Japanese grocery
            store, or order it online.</li>
        <li>Sesame Seeds: You can use black, white, or a combination of white and black sesame seeds. I recommend
            toasting them in a frying pan for 5 minutes, and it`ll add a wonderful nutty flavor and aroma to your rolls.
